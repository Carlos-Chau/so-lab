## About
This is the repository for [So Lab](https://so-lab.netlify.app/). It was built from [the Greene Lab Website template](https://github.com/greenelab/lab-website-template)

## Brief notes about the Greene Lab Website Template
- Greene Lab Website template has [instructions](https://github.com/greenelab/lab-website-template#documentation) on how to use it to build your own lab website
- The [**Get Started**](https://github.com/greenelab/lab-website-template/wiki/Get-Started) page teaches you to clone the repository and link to it Netlify for generating the website
- If your Netlify-generated website only shows a large icon (as was in my case), follow the [Publish your site](https://github.com/greenelab/lab-website-template/wiki/Get-Started#publish-your-site) instructions to fix it.
- The website is organised into **Components** (such as header, research-list). See the [Components](https://github.com/greenelab/lab-website-template/wiki/Components) page on how to edit them
- The research-list component uses Greenelab's Manubot program for generating the publication list. Manubot is automatically run after you push `research-input` to Github. See [this page](https://github.com/greenelab/lab-website-template/wiki/Basic-Editing#generate-citations) for further details
- If Manubot returns error, consider manually compiling the `research-output` file
